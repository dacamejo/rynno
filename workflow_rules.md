# Working Rules

1. Keep the local `rynno` repository synchronized with GitHub so no divergence occurs between branches and remotes.
2. Commit and push every new local change so GitHub always reflects the latest mature state of the project.
3. Operate in unsupervised development loops (development → PR → test → loop) without requiring manual PR reviews unless explicitly requested.
4. Notify the user when PRs are opened or closed and summarize progress; otherwise continue working independently.
5. Capture and persist any important workflow decisions or reminders in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for future recall.
